# Pocky & Rocky (SNES) Orb Hack

## Changes
Makes the following change
to the US version of the SNES game
*Pocky & Rocky*
in accordance with a 2017 post by user acediez
in the romhacking.net thread
*Hack ideas: for those without the skill but with all the ideas*:

In the original game, picking up a red orb while in possession of blue orbs
reverts the weapon level back to its lowest, and vice versa.
This hack shares the weapon level between blue and red orbs,
so the player never gets punished for picking up orbs.

## Download
The latest release can be found on the
[releases page](https://github.com/lightbulb-sun/pocky-orbs/releases).
Patch the original ROM with one of the `.bsdiff`, `.ips` or `.bps` files
to create the hack.
